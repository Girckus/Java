# Java - Basic Concepts

This folder contains a comprehensive collection of examples covering the **fundamental features of the Java programming language**, updated up to **Java version 23**. It is designed for learners who want to understand or revisit Java’s core syntax and functionality through organized and practical code samples.

## Directory Structure

Each subfolder focuses on a specific concept:

- `Annotations/` – Using built-in and custom annotations.
- `Arrays/` – Declaration, initialization, and manipulation of arrays.
- `Assertivas/` – Usage of Java `assert` statements.
- `Classes Abstratas/` – Abstract classes and their usage.
- `Classes/` – Defining and using regular classes.
- `Classes Seladas/` – Sealed classes and their hierarchy restrictions (Java 17+).
- `Enumerações/` – Enumerations (`enum`) and related functionality.
- `Exceções/` – Exception handling with `try`, `catch`, `throw`, `throws`, and `finally`.
- `Genéricos/` – Generic classes, methods, and type bounds.
- `Herança/` – Inheritance and superclass/subclass relationships.
- `Instruções de Controle/` – Control flow statements: `if`, `switch`, loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).
- `Interfaces/` – Interface declaration, default/static methods, and implementation.
- `Lambdas/` – Lambda expressions (functional programming style).
- `Method Reference/` – Method references as an alternative to lambdas.
- `Modificadores de Acesso/` – Access modifiers: `public`, `private`, `protected`, and package-private.
- `Módulos/` – Java Platform Module System (JPMS) basics.
- `Multithreading/` – Multithreading and synchronization.
- `Métodos/` – Method definition, parameters, return types, and overloading.
- `Operadores/` – Arithmetic, logical, bitwise, relational, and ternary operators.
- `Polimorfismo/` – Polymorphism through method overriding and dynamic binding.
- `Records/` – Immutable data carrier classes (`record`) introduced in Java 14+.
- `Saída Formatada/` – Formatted output using `System.out.printf()` and `String.format()`.
- `Strings/` – String operations and manipulation.
- `Tipos Primitivos/` – Java primitive data types and type casting.
- `Variáveis e Constantes/` – Declaring variables and constants (`final` keyword).
- `Wrapper/` – Wrapper classes for primitives and autoboxing/unboxing.

## Requirements

- Java 17+ (Java 23 recommended to explore newer features like records and sealed classes)
- Terminal or IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java support)

## How to Compile and Run

Open a terminal and navigate to any subfolder with `.java` files:

```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName
```

Alternatively, use an IDE to open the folder and run the class with the `main` method.

## Purpose

This folder serves as:

- A structured introduction to Java for beginners
- A review and refresher on Java basics
- A modular reference for educators, students, and developers
